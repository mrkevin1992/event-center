This is an event center website that I made for the KM Tennis Center. It contains pages such as a home page, an events page for making reservations, a menu page for ordering food, a location page which details where it is, and a contact us page where you can submit your information for my fake company to contact you.

I have built websites before, but never using flexbox layout. I used the flexbox on the homepage in the About Us and Featured Event sections, as well as on the Events Page. It was cool to see it my layout switch depending on the page width.

I like that the css is in its own stylesheet and shared by all the pages. It's easy to make changes to the style since it's in an external file.

I hope you enjoyed this simple HTML Event Webpage!
